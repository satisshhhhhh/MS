-- Creating Sales Table

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales;
CREATE TABLE sales (
    brand VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    segment VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (brand, segment)
);


-- Inserting values into Sales Table

INSERT INTO sales (brand, segment, quantity)
VALUES
    ('ABC', 'Premium', 100),
    ('ABC', 'Basic', 200),
    ('XYZ', 'Premium', 100),
    ('XYZ', 'Basic', 300);


-- Viewing all data

select * from sales;


-- Roll up

SELECT
    brand,
    segment,
    SUM (quantity)
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP (brand, segment)
ORDER BY
    brand,
    segment;


-- slice

SELECT
    *
FROM
    sales
WHERE
	segment = 'Basic';


-- Dice

SELECT
    *
FROM
    sales
WHERE
	segment = 'Basic' AND quantity > 250;

-- Drill down

SELECT * FROM sales WHERE region = 'North America';

SELECT * FROM sales WHERE region = 'North America' AND country = 'United States';

SELECT * FROM sales WHERE region = 'North America' AND country = 'United States' AND city = 'New York';

-- This example starts with all sales data for the region "North America", 
-- and then drills down to sales data for the country "United States", 
-- and finally drills down to sales data for the city "New York". 
-- You can use similar queries to drill down into data for other regions, countries, and cities.
