1) SQL Query to illustrate the basic functionality of CUBE.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT employeeid), departmentid, city
FROM Employee1
GROUP BY
CUBE(departmentid,city);
-- In the above example, we have tried to find the count of employees along with each department and city.


/* 2) Find the number of distinct employees in each department 
grouped by their salaries earning a salary between 12000 and 13000./
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT employeeid), departmentid, salary
FROM Employee1
WHERE salary BETWEEN '12000' AND '13000'
GROUP BY
CUBE(departmentid,salary);
-- The above example illustrates the use of the WHERE clause in the CUBE query.



-- 3) Summarize the salaries of employees along with each department and city and salary.
SELECT sum(salary),departmentid, city
FROM employee1
GROUP BY
CUBE(departmentid,city,salary);



-- 4) Summarize the salaries of employees from Mumbai and Thane along with each 
-- department(with department name in the resulting set) ordered by salaries and 
-- departmentname.
SELECT sum(e.salary),d.departmentname, city
FROM employees as e INNER JOIN department as d
ON e.departmentid = d.departmentid
WHERE e.city = 'Mumbai' OR e.city = 'Thane'
GROUP BY
CUBE(d.departmentname,e.city)
HAVING SUM(e.salary) < '60000'
ORDER BY sum(e.salary)DESC ,d.departmentname ASC;
