CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery)

# Install burpsuite
sudo apt install burpsuite

# Open Burpsuite
burpsuite

# Accept all prompts, once burpsuite is on

# Go to Proxy > Intercept 
Turn Incerpt to off if it is on

#Click on Open Browser

# This is the browser provided by burpsuite on which we will try CSRF


#Once the browser is open enter the dvwa login url
127.0.0.1/dvwa/

# Enter username "admin" and password "password"

Set DVWA Security to low

Go to CSRF

# Go to burpsuite and turn Intercept to on
Once intercept is on it will capture all the requests sent by the victim

# Enter new password and confirm password then click on change

Burpsuite will open once you click on change you can see the generated url for changing 
password 
# We can use this url by sending it to someone else and once clicked by them the
password of their account will be changed by our specified one!

So now we can see the password entered by victim i.e "2001" on the first line
So as an hacker we can change the password and click on Intercept to off so it will 
send the given request from victims machine to the server

# Once you turn off Intercept the req will be sent and you will see password changed
# Note: you will use this password as your DVWA login password so remember it!

# So as we got the password change url we can copy it encode it and send it to different
user so that query will execute changing the password of their account
# As this url will be reflected to victim's machine we will encode the url
select the url and click (ctrl + u)

eg. 
# Generated Url
GET 127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=password&password_conf=password&Change=Change

# Encoded Url
GET /dvwa/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new%3dpassword%26password_conf%3dpassword%26Change%3dChange 
(Encoded url will be after "GET /dvwa/vulnerabilities/csrf/?")
